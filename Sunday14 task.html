        <h3>You may be surprised how cost-effective the right HDI PCB layout can be.</h3>
        
        <p>Sierra Circuits brings you reliable HDI printed circuit boards by ensuring meticulous planning in your stack-up. <br/> This strategic approach not only optimizes HDI PCB production costs but also accelerates your time-to-market through streamlined design efficiency. <br/> And in terms of reliability, microvias out-perform typical through-holes almost every time.</p>
    <ul>
        <Li> Down to 1.5-mil trace space, 2-mil holes</Li>
        <li>Blind vias, buried vias, and microvias</li>
        <li>Up to 4 lamination cycles</li>
        <li>Fine lines and via-in-pad technology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To achieve the most cost-effective HDI PCB, various factors must be taken into account, including yield, material type, via drilling methods, and imaging. High-density interconnect offers advantages such as higher yield rates due to improved control of drill-to-copper and the utilization of smaller traces that may ultimately result in fewer layers.</p>
    <p><strong>It is crucial to engage with our experts early in the design process to identify materials that strike the optimal balance between price, manufacturability, and performance for your specific construction needs. </strong></p>
